## Project: Build a Traffic Sign Recognition Program

### Overview

In this project, you will use what you've learned about deep neural networks and convolutional neural networks to classify traffic signs. You will train a model so it can decode traffic signs from natural images by using the [German Traffic Sign Dataset](http://benchmark.ini.rub.de/?section=gtsrb&subsection=dataset). After the model is trained, you will then test your model program on new images of traffic signs you find on the web, or, if you're feeling adventurous pictures of traffic signs you find locally!

### Dataset

Download the dataset. This is a pickled dataset in which we've already resized the images to 32x32.

### Implementation

#### Architecture

I used the LeNet Architecture to train/evaluate and predict the sign images. It is using 3 convolution layers and 3 fully connected layers.
